Mutations in ARX cause a spectrum of ARX- associated disorders, including X-linked mental retardation, X-linked infantile spasms and X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia. A proportion of individuals with each of these disorders also has autism spectrum disorder. Category 4 evidence for the role of ARX in idiopathic evidence includes two studies in which the authors screened for ARX mutations in individuals with autism. In one study of 226 males with ASD+ID, no mutations were found (Chase et al. 2007). In another study, two families each carried a 24-bp duplication in ARX, and three individuals had autism or autistic features in addition to epilepsy or ID.

ATP10A	57194	12851639	TAS	Genetic Association ; Conflicting studies have shown positive genetic association and no genetic association of the ATP10C gene with autism. Candidate gene based on being in 15q11-13 duplication region. Linkage (Freitag, 2007) and association studies have inconsistent findings in this autism candidate region. Nurmi et al., (2001) found the marker D15S122, located at the 5’ end of the gene UBE3A, associated with autism in the Collaborative Linkage Study of Autism (CLSA); however, Cook et al., (1998) could not find any association between the same locus and autism. Subsequently, Nurmi et al., (2003a) failed to replicate the initial finding in a larger sample, while they described the preferential transmission of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1047700 and rs1345098 and a three-SNPs haplotype in ATP10A. The significant association of ATP10A (Nurmi et al., 2003a), however, was not observed in a previous report by Kim et al., (2002).

CNTN4	152330	19404257	TAS	Rare Single Gene Mutation ; Several studies have found rare single gene variations in the CNTN4 gene in patients with ASD. These variations include deletions, missense mutations and a duplication. For example, a deletion in the CNTN4 gene was found in a patient with PDD-NOS and mild intellectual disability (Leblond et al., 2012). On the contrary, one study attempted to find a genetic association between CNTN4 variants and autism in a sample of CORA families but did not find any statistically significant results. Inherited (maternal and paternal) deletions observed in 7/~2000 unrelated cases and 0/~2500 controls, 1/7 unrelated individuals confirmed by qPCR (2 sibs actually confirmed). Statistical support for effect at this gene (4.7 x 10-4) is similar to that observed for either 15q11-13 or NRXN1, but still nominal given number of tests performed. Inherited duplications may also be enriched in cases with 7 unrelated probands carrying such events versus only 1 control (p = 0.0078) (Glessner JT et al.). Paternally inherited deletions observed in 2/3 autistic siblings from screen of 80 probands, paternally inherited duplication seen in a third unrelated child with autism, no similar event in > 750 controls including those from NIMH normal control initiative, resulting in nominal significance (Roohi J et al.).

Among these, one study (Li et al., 2010) found positive association with the Chinese Han population. In addition, rare variants in the CNTNAP2 gene, including deletions and nonsynonymous changes, are also suggested to play a role in autism, ID, DD and language impairment. Interestingly, positive associations with CNTNAP2 and selective mutism, epilepsy and specific language impairment have also been found. Category 4.3 evidence + accessory evidence (involvement in language impairment). Syndromic because of apparent causative mutations in focal epilepsy and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. Multiple lines of evidence point to CNTNAP2 in autism, including common SNP association to autism diagnosis (Arking et al., 2008; PMID: 18179894), a modest increase in the burden of rare variants identified by re-sequencing in individuals with autism (Bakkaloglu et al., 2008; PMID: 18179895), and common SNP association with quantitative language phenotype in individuals with autism (Alarcon et al., 2008; PMID: 18179893).

EGR2	1959	16709250	TAS	Genetic Association ; Differential expression of the EGR2 gene has been shown to occur in some autistic individuals (Hu et al., 2006). EGR2 expression was found to be reduced in individuals with autism as well as Rett syndrome, and it appears that EGR2 and MECP2 can regulate each other's expression (Swanberg et al., 2009). Hu and colleagues (2006) studied three sets of male monozygotic twins who were discordant for severity of autism. In that study, there was a significant difference in the expression level of F13A1 among the three sets of twins, suggesting that this gene may play a role.

GLO1	2739	15386471	TAS	Genetic Association ; Genetic association has been found between the GLO1 gene and autism (Junaid et al., 2004). However, no genetic association was found between GLO1 and autism in Finnish, Italian and Caucasian-American population cohorts. Separately, genetic association was found between GLO1 and panic disorder without agoraphobia in an Italian population cohort (Politi et al., 2006). A polymorphism was identified by 2D gel electrophoresis comparing autism brain to control: 4/8 cases and 2/3 controls homozygous for acidic form of GLO1 protein. In 7/8 original cases the A allele is present versus 5/9 controls. The protein variant was determined to be the result of common cSNP, and thus followed-up by case-control analysis in AGRE patients versus complicated combination of control brains and lymphoblastoid cells from Utah families. A significant enrichment of the A allele was observed in cases versus controls (p < 0.0001), and a 40% reduction in GLO1 activity in cases (n=8) versus normal controls (n=4) was observed. Two genetic studies larger than the initial proteomics work failed to see an association between common variants and autism. A third failed to find evidence of case-control differences or increased frequency of A allele in cases but paradoxically found evidence for increased transmission of A allele to unaffected sibs in a family based study (TDT and FBAT P < 0.00001). Expression levels are reduced relative to controls in depressed individuals in depressed state. Very nice molecular work from mouse supports a role of GLO1 in modulation of anxiety (Junaid MA et al.).		SFARI	GLO1	autism spectrum disorder	SFARIGeneScore	4	0.4

MARK1	4139	18492799	TAS	Genetic association/Functional ; Several SNPs within the MARK1 gene were significantly associated with ASDs by transmission disequilibrium tests in a family-based association study of multiplex ASD families.  The ASD-associated SNP rs12410279 was found to modulate the level of MARK1 transcription.  Furthermore, MARK1 was overexpressed in the prefrontal cortex of patients with autism and causes changes in the function of cortical dendrites (Maussion et al., 2008). A TDT in 276 AGRE families using 126 SNPs across the 1q41 interval suggested association with SNPs and haplotypes in the MARK1 gene. One associated SNP (rs12410279) was observed to modulate transcription of MARK1. The gene is overexpressed in the prefrontal cortex (BA46) but not in cerebellar granule cells, in brain tissues from patients. Overexpression and silencing of MARK1 resulted in significantly shorter dendrite length in mouse neocortical neurons and modified dendritic transport speed (Maussion G et al.).

MECP2	4204	11807877	TAS	Syndromic ; Mutations in the MECP2 gene underlie Rett syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder. Some studies have found that rare variations in the MECP2 gene are associated with autism, while others have looked and found no variants in autistic patients. It appears that EGR2 and MECP2 can regulate each other's expression (Swanberg et al., 2009). Mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome (Amir et al., 1999), which has been recognized as an autism spectrum disorder (DSM-IV). MECP2 mutations were identified in four females and one male with a clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (Watson et al., 2001). Brain samples from several related neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, pervasive developmental disorder, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes showed significant differences in MECP2 expression from age-matched controls by apparently different transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (Samaco et al., 2004). Significant defects in UBE3A/E6AP and GABRB3 expression has been observed in MECP2 deficient mice and human Rett, Angelman and autism brains compared with controls (Samaco et al., 2005). A significant reduction in frontal cortex MECP2 expression compared to age-matched controls was found in autism (79%), RTT (100%), Angelman syndrome (100%), Prader-Willi syndrome (75%), Down syndrome (60%), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (100%) samples. As well, significantly increased MECP2 promoter methylation was seen in autistic male frontal cortex compared to controls (Nagarajan et al., 2006).

Brain samples from several related neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, pervasive developmental disorder, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes showed significant differences in MECP2 expression from age-matched controls by apparently different transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (Samaco et al., 2004). Significant defects in UBE3A/E6AP and GABRB3 expression has been observed in MECP2 deficient mice and human Rett, Angelman and autism brains compared with controls (Samaco et al., 2005). A significant reduction in frontal cortex MECP2 expression compared to age-matched controls was found in autism (79%), RTT (100%), Angelman syndrome (100%), Prader-Willi syndrome (75%), Down syndrome (60%), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (100%) samples. As well, significantly increased MECP2 promoter methylation was seen in autistic male frontal cortex compared to controls (Nagarajan et al., 2006). Rare mutations and genetic association with MECP2 has been identified in autistic individuals (Loat et al., 2008). In addition, autism and other neuropsychiatric symptoms are prevalent in individuals with MECP2 duplication syndrome (Ramocki et al., 2009).

In addition, RAI1 variants have been associated with Potocki-Lupski and Smith-Magenis syndromes. RAI1 is included in a region that is duplicated in an individual with autism/MR, and shows altered gene expression (PMID: 17334992). It was identified as the single gene in this interval that overlaps with the region affected in Potocki-Lupski syndrome, making it those most likely candidate. There is no evidence implicating it in idiopathic autism.		SFARI	RAI1	autism spectrum disorder	SFARIGeneScore	S	0.0

ZBTB16	7704	22843504	TAS	Genetic association ; A SNP within the ZBTB16 gene showed association in the secondary analyses in a combined AGP GWA sample (Anney et al., 2012).		SFARI	ZBTB16	autism spectrum disorder	
ZNF18	7566	22511880	TAS	Rare single gene mutation ; A homozygous mutation in the ZNF18 gene was found to segregate perfectly with disease in a multiplex ASD family.  No homozygotes for this mutation were observed in 1340 control chromosomes.  An additional homozygous mutation, as well as a compound heterozygous mutation, in the ZNF18 gene were identified in two ASD cases from the replication cohort that were not observed in 371 controls (Chahrour et al., 2012).		SFARI	ZNF18	autism spectrum disorder	
ZNF407	55628	23195952	TAS	Rare Single Gene Mutation ; A de novo balanced translocation disrupting the ZNF407 gene was identified in a patient with intellectual disability and autistic phenotypes, and additional variants in the ZNF407 gene were identified in a separate cohort of patients with non-syndromic ID (Ren et al., 2012).		SFARI	ZNF407	autism spectrum disorder	
ZNF517	340385	23275889	TAS	Rare single gene mutation ; A novel recurrent deletion involving the ZNF517 gene was identified in two unrelated ASD cases (Prasad et al., 2012).		SFARI	ZNF517	autism spectrum disorder	
ZNF827	152485	22843504	TAS	Genetic association ; A SNP within the ZNF827 gene showed association in the secondary analyses in a combined AGP GWA sample (Anney et al., 2012).		SFARI	ZNF827	autism spectrum disorder	
ZSWIM5	57643	22016809	TAS	Rare Single Gene Mutation ; A rare deletion in the ZSWIM5 gene has been identified with ASD (Salyakina et al., 2011).		SFARI	ZSWIM5	autism spectrum disorder
