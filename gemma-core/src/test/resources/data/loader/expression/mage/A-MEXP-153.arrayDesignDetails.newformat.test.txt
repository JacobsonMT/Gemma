Printing Protocol	Introduction: This cDNA array contains two replicates of 6258 features out of which 5494 (5159 unique) originate from an in-house sequenced Mus musculus lateral ventricle wall cDNA library. The remaining features are controls of different kind, including the Lucidea score card probe sequences (Amersham), array production controls, empty features and others.   Origin of clones: The clones are cloned into a pCMVSport6 vector carrying a gene for ampicillin resistance. The average length of the inserts for these libraries is 2.0 kb. The in-house sequenced cDNA libraries were plated and single colonies picked for 5-sequencing using the RSP primer (5-CAC ACA GGA AAC AGC TAT GAC-3). Obtained sequences were assembled using the Paracel Transcript Assembler and all unique sequences and one representative for each cluster were chosen for rearraying and cDNA array production.  Plasmid purification, insert amplification and PCR-product purification: The cDNA inserts were amplified in 100-?l reaction volume using 10 pmoles of both RSP and USP (5-CGT TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AG-3) primers, 0.2 ?M dNTPs and 1.5 units of Platinum DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and accompanying buffers. The temperature cycling was carried out using following scheme: 5 min at 95?C, 35x(1 min at 95?C, 4 min at 64?C, 4 min at 72?C) and 10 min at 72?C. The PCR reactions were set up using the PlateMate 2x2 liquid handler (Matrix) and the temperature cycling carried out using MJ Tetrad thermocyclers (MJ Research). Amplified PCR products were purified using the Multiscreen-PCR384 filter plates (Millipore) automated on the Biorobot 8000 and Microlab 4200 liquid handler (Hamilton). Residual salt was removed using a wash step and elution was carried out in 25-30 ?l sterile water. Purified product was transferred to print plates containing an appropriate volume of 99.9% DMSO to yield 20-?l print plates with 50% DMSO. The remaining part of the purified product was stored for future use.  Printing: The purified clones were printed onto UltraGAPS slides (Corning) using the QArray arrayer (Genetix) into three fields of 16 blocks each. The duplicate features were printed in the same block, but not adjacent to each other (different rows and columns). Each batch of printing results in approximately 75 slides. The features are separated by a feature-to-feature centre distance of 175 ?m. The average diameter of a feature is approximately 120 ?m. After printing the DNA was attached to the amino silane coating of the arrays using 250 mJ UV-light/cm2. No further processing was carried out.  Slides were stored at room temperature in dark until used in hybridisation.  Quality control steps: 1. The complete set of clones was re-sequenced to verify that the rearranging of the clones was done successfully. 2. Approximately 10% of the selected probes are sequenced after the purification of the PCR product in order to verify that the plates are not rotated at any of the steps during the process.  3. Agarose gel electrophoresis is carried out on an additional 10% of the clones to verify that the amplification of the probes has been successful and specific. 4. For each batch of printed arrays hybridisation using Syto61, Cy5-labelled random 9-mer and two labelled RNA samples is carried out to verify that the signal intensities and ratios are as for the previous batches.
