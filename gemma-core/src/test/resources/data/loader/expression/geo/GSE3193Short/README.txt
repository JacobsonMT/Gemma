GSE3193trick_family.soft.gz contains a file modified from GSE3193_family.soft.gz (which in turn is a 'chopped' soft file).

The 'trick' version has been modified to contain 4 extremely similar array designs, all with the same sequences, but slightly different probe ids (mostly they are the same), but the same values for probe is are used (1-20).

The number of samples has also been reduced, to 17. the resulting data matrix should have 17 columns and 20 rows.
