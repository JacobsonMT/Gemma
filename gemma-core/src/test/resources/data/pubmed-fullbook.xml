As discussions progressed, the focus expanded from drugs and biologics to include medical devices. In 2009, the IOM appointed a 14-person committee to oversee the study. Consistent with its charge (which is presented in full in Appendix A), the committee examined the epidemiology, impact, and treatment of rare diseases as context for an assessment of research and development; investigated the strengths and limitations of the current development pathways for new drugs, medical devices, and biologics for rare diseases; assessed public policies that may influence research and development decisions involving rare diseases and orphan products; and developed recommendations for an integrated national policy on rare diseases research and orphan product development. This report presents the committee's conclusions and recommendations. It is written for a broad and diverse audience, including public officials in research and regulatory agencies; advocacy and philanthropic groups that support rare diseases research and orphan product development; companies that develop pharmaceutical, medical device, and biologic products; academic medical centers, research institutes, and researchers engaged in basic and clinical research; and the interested general public.</AbstractText> 				<CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2010, National Academy of Sciences.</CopyrightInformation> 			</Abstract> 			<Sections> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="nap12953.fm.s1">The National Academies</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="nap12953.fm.s2">Committee on Accelerating Rare Diseases Research and Orphan Product Development</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="nap12953.fm.s5">Acknowledgments</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="nap12953.fm.s6">Reviewers</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="nap12953.fm.s7">Preface</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="summary">Summary</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">1</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch1">Introduction</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">2</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch2">Profile of Rare Diseases</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">3</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch3">Regulatory Framework for Drugs for Rare Diseases</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">4</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch4">Discovery Research for Rare Diseases and Orphan Product Development</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">5</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch5">Development of New Therapeutic Drugs and Biologics for Rare Diseases</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">6</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch6">Coverage and Reimbursement: Incentives and Disincentives for Product Development</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">7</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch7">Medical Devices: Research and Development for Rare Diseases</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<LocationLabel Type="chapter">8</LocationLabel> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="ch8">Toward an Integrated Approach to Accelerating Research and Product Development for Rare Diseases </SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="references.rl1">References</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 				<Section> 					<SectionTitle book="nap12953" part="appendixes.appgroup1">Appendixes</SectionTitle> 				</Section> 			</Sections> 		</BookDocument> 		<PubmedBookData> 			<History> 				<PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"> 					<Year>2011</Year> 					<Month>8</Month> 					<Day>6</Day> 					<Hour>6</Hour> 					<Minute>0</Minute> 				</PubMedPubDate> 				<PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"> 					<Year>2011</Year> 					<Month>8</Month> 					<Day>6</Day> 					<Hour>6</Hour> 					<Minute>0</Minute> 				</PubMedPubDate> 				<PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"> 					<Year>2011</Year> 					<Month>8</Month> 					<Day>6</Day> 					<Hour>6</Hour> 					<Minute>0</Minute> 				</PubMedPubDate> 			</History> 			<PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus> 			<ArticleIdList> 				<ArticleId IdType="pubmed">21796826</ArticleId> 			</ArticleIdList> 		</PubmedBookData> 	</PubmedBookArticle> </PubmedArticleSet>
