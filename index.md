## Overview
Gemma is a set of tools for genomics data meta-analysis, currently primarily targeted at the analysis of gene expression profiles. Gemma contains data from thousands of public studies, referencing thousands of published papers. Users can search, access and visualize coexpression and differential expression results.

### Key features:
- Re-annotated expression platforms at the sequence level, which allows for more consistent cross-platform comparisons.
- Support for a variety of expression technologies, including Affymetrix, Illumina and other oligonucleotide arrays, one channel and ratiometric cDNA arrays and RNA-seq data.
- Manual and automated annotation of datasets, that enhance usability of data.
- Access through RESTful web services allows incorporation of data and capabilities of Gemma in any other software.
- Users have the option to securely upload their own data, with an option to be privately shared with other users of their choice. 
- Possibility to create and save gene sets or dataset groups for ease of use in queries.
