1. Resolved issues and improvements

- Completely new 'dataset chooser' interface. This allows you to define "Expression 
experiment sets' that can be used for your analyses. Currently user-customized sets
 are stored in a browser cookie; storing these on our server will be supported in the future.
- Differential expression interface revamped.
- Differential expression supports meta-analysis.
- Coexpression interface revised.
- Performance improvements in many areas.
- Numerous bug fixes and behind-the-scenes enhancements.

2. Known issues

- The coexpression search page does not display correctly in Internet Explorer for Windows, version 6 or earlier 
(though it is functional for the most part). We recommend IE users upgrade to version 7.

3. Installing and running Gemma at your location

Gemma is designed to be portable. However, we have not yet completed
documenting the build and installation procedure. If you are
interested in installing Gemma, please contact gemma@bioinformatics.ubc.ca.

4. Downloading data

Many of the pages in Gemma have links for downloading data of various
types. Downloads of more complete data sets representing the Gemma
database will be made available soon.
