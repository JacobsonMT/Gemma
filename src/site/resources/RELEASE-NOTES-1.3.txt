1. Resolved issues and improvements


Major new features
* Users can register to gain access to additional features.
* Registered users can upload their own expression data and securely integrate it into the Gemma system.
* Registered user have a 'dashboard' to manage their data sets.
* A new visualization feature allows viewing of expression profiles in coexpression and differential expression.

Other new stuff
* Complete installation instructions are provided for those who want to run Gemma locally.
* Coexpression results now always provide information on probe specificity.
* The expression experiment details interface has been rewritten to make it easier to use.
* Improved usability for differential expression meta-analysis. Experimental factors are now easier to select.

Improvements
* Much more documentation in many areas.
* Major performance improvements throughout. A huge amount of work went into speeding up many aspects of Gemma, both at the software and hardware level.
* Differential expression analyses can be done on experiments that have more than two factors.
* API improvments under the hood: Code cleanup and more use of Java 5 features, resulting in the removal of ~20,000 lines of code.

In total at least 150 bugs and feature requests have been closed.

More changes are on the way. High on our list are additional visualization tools, tools for users to store 'favorite' queries, and integration of additional data.

There are certainly still bugs, quirks and missing features and documentation. Please let us know if there is a problem that is keeping you from using Gemma productively.



2. Known issues

- The coexpression search page does not display correctly in Internet Explorer for Windows, version 6 or earlier 
(though it is functional for the most part). We recommend IE users upgrade to version 7.

3. Installing and running Gemma at your location

Gemma is designed to be portable; installation instructions on the Gemma wiki.

4. Downloading data

Many of the pages in Gemma have links for downloading data of various
types. Downloads of more complete data sets representing the Gemma
database will be made available soon.
