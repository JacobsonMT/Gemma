1. Known issues

* Web application

- Some pages do not display properly in Windows Internet Explorer 6,
  in particular the Coexpression search page.

- 'Custom' coexpression searches are temporarily disabled. This is
  primarily to allow us to ensure the 'canned' analysis searches are
  performing as expected. A high-performance version of 'custom'
  searches will be available before Gemma 1.1 is released.

- Help pages are missing for many pages. However, most pages are
  either mostly self-explanatory, have embedded help (question mark
  icons), or "tool-tips" are available if you hover over a field or
  label.

* Other

We are not aware of any serious 'back-end' bugs at this time.

Gemma is under active development, so there are many missing planned
features. A roadmap for the future of Gemma will be made available
soon.

2. Installing and running Gemma at your location

Gemma is designed to be portable. However, we have not yet completed
documenting the build and installation procedure. If you are
interested in installing Gemma, please contact gemma@bioinformatics.ubc.ca.

3. Downloading data

Many of the pages in Gemma have links for downloading data of various
types. Downloads of more complete data sets representing the Gemma
database will be made available soon.
