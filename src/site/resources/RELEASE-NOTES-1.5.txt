Improvements

Version 1.5 bring numerous updates and features. Most prominent is the support for "user groups"
and more types of "user-specific" data including sets of expression studies ("dataset groups") and genes
("gene groups"). The use of gene and dataset has been integrated into several parts of the system.

The administrative tools have continued to evolve. Authenticated users will have access to interfaces for
managing the data they have created as well as the permissions for other users to access that data.
 
Bug fixes
