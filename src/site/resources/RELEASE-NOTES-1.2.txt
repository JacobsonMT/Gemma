1. Resolved issues and improvements

Gemma 1.3 is a major new release. At least 150 bug and feature requests have been closed.

Major new features
- Users can register to gain access to additional features
- Registered users can upload their own expression data and securely integrate it into the Gemma system
- Registered users have a 'dashboard' to manage their data sets
- A new visualization feature allows viewing expression profiles in coexpression and differential expression analyses.

Other new stuff
- Complete installation instructions are provided for those who want to run Gemma locally
- Coexpression results now always provide information on probe specificity
- The expression experiment details interface has been rewritten to make it easier to use.
- Differential expression meta-analysis has been made more usable by making experimental factors easier to select.

Improvements
- Much more documentation in many area
- Major performance improvements throughout. 
- Differential expression analyses can be run on experiments that have more than two factors (though you are still limited to using two factors in analysis)
- API improvements under the hood: code cleanup and removal of ~20,000 lines of unneeded code.
- Numerous other bug fixes and behind-the-scenes enhancements.

2. Known issues

- The coexpression search page does not display correctly in Internet Explorer for Windows, version 6 or earlier 
(though it is functional for the most part). We recommend IE users upgrade to version 7.

3. Installing and running Gemma at your location

Installation instructions are now available on the Gemma Wiki, http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/confluence/display/gemma/Home

4. Downloading data

Many of the pages in Gemma have links for downloading data of various
types. Downloads of more complete data sets representing the Gemma
database will be made available soon.
