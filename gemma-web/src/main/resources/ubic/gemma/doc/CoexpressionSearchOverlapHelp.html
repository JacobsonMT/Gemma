	The <strong>GO Overlap %</strong> for a pair of co-expressed genes is the percentage of overlap between the
	Gene Ontology terms (including all parents) for that Gene pair (queried and co-expressed gene).  
	The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of common GO terms by the total number 
	of unique GO terms (including parents) that the queried gene has.
