	Welcome to Gemma
</h2>
<p>
	Gemma is a database and software system for the
	<strong>meta-analysis of gene expression data</strong>. Currently Gemma
	is focused on using "guilt-by-association" to assist in gene function
	prediction. Later stages of the project will introduce additional types
	of analysis.

	<strong>To use Gemma</strong>, enter a term to locate a gene of
	interest; Gemma will tell you what genes are coexpressed (have
	correlated expression profiles) with your selected genes. Gemma
	contains data from hundreds of public microarray data sets.
