	The differential expression of genes in Gemma is determined by
	statistical tests run on datasets based on the experiment's design.
	That is, datasets containing 1 factor and 2 factor values will have
	differential evidence based on a
	<strong>t-test</strong>. Datasets with 1 factor and more than 2 factor
	values will have differential evidence based on a
	<strong>one way anova</strong>. Datasets with 2 factors and an
	incomplete block design will have differential evidence based on a
	<strong>two way anova without interactions</strong>, and those with a
	complete block design will have evidence based on a
	<strong>2 way anova with interactions</strong>.

	<strong>Inputs:</strong>
	<br />
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Gene Official Symbol:</em> The search will look for and return
			experiments for which the input query gene has differential evidence.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Threshold:</em> Only genes with a q-value less than the input
			threshold are returned from the search.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<strong><br> <br>Results:</strong>
	<br />
	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Experiment:</em> The experiment containing the queried gene.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Factors:</em> The factors for which the queried gene has
			differential expression evidence. For example, genes that belong to
			experiments analyzed with one way anova will have 1 factor.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Probe:</em> The probes that align with the queried gene in the
			given experiment.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>FDR (q):</em> The criteria used to determine whether the
			differential test (t-test, one way anova, two way anova) for the gene
			is significant or not. The q value is the minimum false discovery
			rate at which this test can be called significant.
		</li>
	</ul>
