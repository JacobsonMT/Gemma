	<h2>
		Differential Expression
	</h2>
	The differential expression of genes in Gemma is determined by
	statistical tests run on datasets based on the experiment's design.
	That is, datasets containing 1 factor and 2 factor values will have
	differential evidence based on a
	<b>t-test</b>.
	<br>
	Datasets with 1 experimental factor and more than 2 factor values will
	have differential evidence based on a
	<b>one way anova</b>.
	<br>
	Datasets with 2 experimental factors and an incomplete block design
	will have differential evidence based on a
	<b>two way anova without interactions</b>.

	<br>
	Datasets with 2 experimental factors and a complete block design will
	have evidence based on a
	<b>2 way anova with interactions</b>.

	<h2>
		Inputs:
	</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Query Gene:</i> The search will look for and return experiments
			for which the input query gene has differential evidence.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Query Genes: </i>The experiments that have differential evidence
			for any of the given genes will be returned.

		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Threshold:</i> Genes with a q-value less than the input threshold
			are returned from the search (default sort order). The threshold is
			igored when computing the meta-analysis results.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Scope:</i> The set of experiments to include in the search.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Results:
	</h2>
	The results contain both the meta-analysis results and the differential
	expression results (dropdown).
	<ul>
		<h3>
			Meta analysis Results
		</h3>
		<li>
			<i>Query Gene:</i> The input query gene(s).
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Meta P-Value:</i> The fisher combined p-value which includes raw
			p-values from datasets with diff evidence for the query gene. In
			cases where multiple probes (n) in a dataset map to the same input
			query gene, the probes are penalized by multiplying by n. The
			smallest p-value is then used in the combined p-value.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i># Datasets Tested In:</i> # datasets with diff results / #
			datasets tested in
		</li>

		<h3>
			Differential Expression Results (dropdown)
		</h3>
		<li>
			<i>Experiment:</i> The experiment with diff evidence for the query
			gene.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Probe:</i> The probe that maps to the query gene. Green indicates
			the probe contributes to the fisher (meta) p-value.
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>Factors:</i> The factors for which the queried gene has
			differential expression evidence. For example, genes that belong to
			experiments analyzed with one way anova will have 1 factor.
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>FDR (q):</i> The criteria used to determine whether the
			differential test (t-test, one way anova, two way anova) for the gene
			is significant or not. The q value is the minimum false discovery
			rate at which this test can be called significant.
		</li>
	</ul>
