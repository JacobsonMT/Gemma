	The differential expression of genes in Gemma is determined by
	statistical tests run on datasets based on the experiment's design.
	That is, datasets containing 1 factor and 2 factor values will have
	differential evidence based on a
	<b>t-test</b>. Datasets with 1 factor and more than 2 factor values
	will have differential evidence based on a
	<b>one way anova</b>. Datasets with 2 factors and an incomplete block
	design will have differential evidence based on a
	<b>two way anova without interactions</b>, and those with a complete
	block design will have evidence based on a
	<b>2 way anova with interactions</b>.

	<h2>
		Inputs:
	</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Query Gene:</i> The search will look for and return experiments
			for which the input query gene has differential evidence.
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>Threshold:</i> Only genes with a q-value less than the input
			threshold are returned from the search.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Results:
	</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Experiment:</i> The experiment containing the queried gene.
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>Factors:</i> The factors for which the queried gene has
			differential expression evidence. For example, genes that belong to
			experiments analyzed with one way anova will have 1 factor.
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>Probe:</i> The probes that align with the queried gene in the
			given experiment.
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>FDR (q):</i> The criteria used to determine whether the
			differential test (t-test, one way anova, two way anova) for the gene
			is significant or not. The q value is the minimum false discovery
			rate at which this test can be called significant.
		</li>
	</ul>
