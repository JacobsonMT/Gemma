		<p>
			The platform/array design page shows a summary of our gene assignment analysis for the 
			current platform. This summary is broken down into categories described below.
		</p>
		<p>
			A "probe" refers to a feature or a set of features on the array that form the primary analytical unit
			and may in fact be made up of a set of probes (e.g. Affymetrix arrays). 
		</p>
		<p>
			A "gene" can be a known gene, a predicted gene, or a potential gene represented only by an alignment 
			(a "probe-aligned region" or PAR). A PAR is only assigned to a probe if it does not map to a known
			or predicted gene.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
				Probes with sequences:
				</p>
				<p>
				The number of probes that have a provided sequence. For some platforms, sequences are missing
				for some or all of its probes. Probes without sequences are excluded from further analysis.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				Probes with genome alignments:
				</p>
				<p>
				The number of probes whose sequences provide an alignment to the genome. Some probe-genome alignments do not
				necessarily meet stringency requirements and are not included in the database.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				Probes mapping to genes:
				</p>
				<p>
				Of probes with alignments, how many are mapped to known genes, predicted genes, and probe-aligned regions
				(a breakdown is provided). The details of the criteria used for determining if an alignment corresponds to 
				a gene (or predicted gene, or a PAR) will be documented elsewhere.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> 
				Unique genes represented
				</p>
				<p>
				The number of distinct known genes, predicted genes, and probea-aligned regions represented in the array.
				This number can be higher or lower than the number of probes mapping because some probes can map to 
				multiple genes, and some genes have more than one probe mapping.
				</p>
			</li>
