		<h3>
			Data sources
		</h3>
		<p>
			We are indebted to the many researchers who have made data publicly available. A list of published papers that relate
			to the data included in gemma is
			<a href="http://localhost:8080/Gemma/bibRef/showAllEeBibRefs.html">here</a>. If your data is in Gemma, and your paper
			is not listed, please
			<a href="mailto:gemma@bioinformatics.ubc.ca">let us know</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Gemma obtains most data from the
			<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus</a> with an increasing contribution from
			<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/">ArrayExpress</a>. We are grateful for the curation efforts at those
			sites, and the technical assistance we've received. We'd like to especially thank Tanya Barrett (NCBI) for answering
			many questions about GEO.
