			Gene Group Manager Help
		</h1>

		<p>
			The manager shows you the gene groups you have currently available. Included in the view are at least three types of
			groups:
		</p>
		<ul class="plainList">
			<li>
				Publicly-available groups that you cannot edit. These are viewable by all users.
			</li>
			<li>
				Groups you can edit. These are groups you have created, or for which someone else has assigned you write
				permissions. They might be private (for your use only or shared with specific other users) or publicly viewable.
			</li>
			<li>
				Private groups you can only view. These are groups that someone else has created and is sharing with you.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			To create a new group, click the icon on the toolbar and give the group a name. You can edit this later.
		</p>

		<p>
			To add genes to your group, select the taxon you will use (A gene group can only have genes from one taxon) from the
			gene picker. Search for genes one at a time, or load them in bulk by pasting a list of identifiers.
		</p>
