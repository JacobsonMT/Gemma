		Expression experiment list help
	</h1>

	<p>
		An 'expression experiment' is a basic unit in Gemma, representing a single study, made up of multiple
		<em>assays</em>. Typically these correspond to data from a single publication (if published) and/or a single GEO or
		ArrayExpress accession.
	</p>

	<p>
		The table of experiments on this page is the complete list of studies available for use; studies which are 'private'
		are not shown unless you have sufficient privileges. Click on a dataset to get full details; click on the magnifying
		glass in the 'assays' column to get a list of the samples.

	<h2>
		Relationships to datasets in GEO and ArrayExpress
	</h2>
	<p>
		While not specifically about this page, this seems as good a place as any to add some details about where data in
		Gemma comes from.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much of the data in Gemma is imported from GEO. In GEO a 'series' (submitted by a researcher) can be associated with
		one or more 'datasets' (curated by GEO). Gemma imports the series, and obtains annotations from the dataset(s) if
		available. Along with these, the 'platform' (array design or microarray type) is also imported. If data is imported
		from ArrayExpress, we reuse the GEO-originated platform if possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that unlike the situation in GEO, a sample can only appear in one experiment. In GEO, 'series' are sometimes
		assembled into 'super-series'; similarly, in GEO some samples appear in multiple overlapping studies. Gemma avoids
		this by removing samples from new data sets which appear in previously imported data sets. We also tend to use
		super-series if the super-series is sufficiently cohesive (in our opinion), but in other cases we import only the
		constituent series independently.
