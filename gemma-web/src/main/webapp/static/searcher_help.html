		Help for search in Gemma
	</h1>

	<h2>
		Search terms
	</h2>

	<p>
		Search terms can be text ("liver"), gene symbols ("ACAT1") or other accession numbers for specific experiments or
		probes. To find out more information regarding a valid search query go 	<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html">here</a>
		
	</p>

	<h2>
		Search results
	</h2>

	<p>
		Each category of search result is presented separately in the table. A link is provided to a detailed view of each
		result items. A separate columns shows the text that matched your query, if available (this will not be shown for
		searches of exact symbols like Genbank identifiers).
	</p>
	<p>
		Results are limited to 500 items.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Search scope
	</h2>
	<p>
		Besides the term(s) you want to search for, you must choose the search scope. Assuming you have cookies enabled in
		your browser, Gemma will remember your settings. It's a good idea to restrict searches to just the items you want to
		avoid longer waits.
	</p>

	<p>
		The available search scopes are:
	</p>

	<ul class="plainList">
		<li>
			Genes, by official symbol, alias, or name. Examples:
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=mGluR5&scope=G">mGluR5</a> or
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptor&scope=G">metabotropic glutamate receptor</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Sequences - The nucleotide sequences used on arrays, often referred to by Genbank identifiers identifier. Examples:
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=AA486221&scope=S">AA486221</a>. You can also retrieve sequences via associated
			genes or probes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Experiments - An expression experiment, searchable by text or the accession. For example
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=GSE60&scope=E">GSE60</a> or
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=liver&scope=E">liver</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Arrays - Expression analysis platforms or 'array designs', such as "
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=HG-U133A&scope=A">HG-U133A</a>".
		</li>
		<li>
			Probes - Components of array platforms, usually referred to by the manufacturer's id, the id in GEO, or a Genbank
			accession. For example,
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=1450202_at&scope=P">1450202_at</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Common tasks
	</h2>

	<h3>
		Find probes for a gene
	</h3>

	<p>
		The best way to do this is to first locate the gene, and follow the link provided to the details page for the genes.
		From there click on the "probes" link to view all probes for that gene.
	</p>

	<p>
		The alternative, of searching for 'probes' with the gene symbol, will yield less precise results.
	</p>


<h2 class="boxed">Boolean Operators</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators.
        Lucene supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).</p>
<a name="N10103"></a><a name="OR"></a>
<h3 class="boxed"></h3>
<p>The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used.
        The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document. This is equivalent to a union using sets.
        The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR.</p>
<p>To search for documents that contain either "jakarta apache" or just "jakarta" use the query:</p>

<pre class="code">"jakarta apache" jakarta</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="code">"jakarta apache" OR jakarta</pre>
<a name="N10116"></a><a name="AND"></a>
<h3 class="boxed">AND</h3>
<p>The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document.
        This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol &amp;&amp; can be used in place of the word AND.</p>
<p>To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" and "Apache Lucene" use the query: </p>
<pre class="code">"jakarta apache" AND "Apache Lucene"</pre>

<a name="N10126"></a><a name="+"></a>
<h3 class="boxed">+</h3>
<p>The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol exist somewhere in a the field of a single document.</p>
<p>To search for documents that must contain "jakarta" and may contain "lucene" use the query:</p>
<pre class="code">+jakarta lucene</pre>
<a name="N10136"></a><a name="NOT"></a>
<h3 class="boxed">NOT</h3>
<p>The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT.
        This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol ! can be used in place of the word NOT.</p>
<p>To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query: </p>

<pre class="code">"jakarta apache" NOT "Apache Lucene"</pre>
<p>Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results:</p>
<pre class="code">NOT "jakarta apache"</pre>
<a name="N1014C"></a><a name="-"></a>
<h3 class="boxed">-</h3>
<p>The "-" or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the "-" symbol.</p>
<p>To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query: </p>
<pre class="code">"jakarta apache" -"Apache Lucene"</pre>
