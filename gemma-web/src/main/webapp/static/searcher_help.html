		Help for search in Gemma
	</h1>

	<h2>
		Search terms
	</h2>

	<p>
		Search terms can be free text ("liver"), gene symbols ("ACAT1") or other accession numbers for specific experiments or
		probes. Here are some more complicated examples:
	<ul class='plainlist'>
		<li>
			female AND cortex - Inteserction of items matching terms. Note that 'AND' must be capitalized
		</li>
		<li>
			female -cortex - Exclusion
		</li>
		<li>
			"cerebral cortex" - search for a phrase.
		</li>
	</ul>


	For detailed information on the supported query syntax see
	<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html">this page</a>, which refers to 'Lucene', the search
	engine employed by Gemma.

	</p>


	<h2>
		Search scope
	</h2>
	<p>
		Besides the term(s) you want to search for, you must choose the search scope. Assuming you have cookies enabled in
		your browser, Gemma will remember your settings. It's a good idea to restrict searches to just the items you want to
		avoid longer waits.
	</p>

	<p>
		The available search scopes are:
	</p>

	<ul class="plainList">
		<li>
			Genes, by official symbol, alias, or name. Examples:
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=mGluR5&scope=G">mGluR5</a> or
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptor&scope=G">metabotropic glutamate receptor</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Sequences - The nucleotide sequences used on arrays, often referred to by Genbank identifiers identifier. Examples:
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=AA486221&scope=S">AA486221</a>. You can also retrieve sequences via associated
			genes or probes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Experiments - An expression experiment, searchable by text or the accession. For example
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=GSE60&scope=E">GSE60</a> or
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=liver&scope=E">liver</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Arrays - Expression analysis platforms or 'array designs', such as "
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=HG-U133A&scope=A">HG-U133A</a>".
		</li>
		<li>
			Probes - Components of array platforms, usually referred to by the manufacturer's id, the id in GEO, or a Genbank
			accession. For example,
			<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=1450202_at&scope=P">1450202_at</a>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>
		Search results
	</h2>

	<p>
		Each category of search result is presented separately in the table. A link is provided to a detailed view of each
		result items. A separate columns shows the text that matched your query, if available (this will not be shown for
		searches of exact symbols like Genbank identifiers).
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that results are limited to 500 items.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Common tasks
	</h2>

	<h3>
		Find probes for a gene
	</h3>

	<p>
		The best way to do this is to first locate the gene, and follow the link provided to the details page for the genes.
		From there click on the "probes" link to view all probes for that gene.
	</p>

	<p>
		The alternative, of searching for 'probes' with the gene symbol, will yield less precise results.
	</p>
