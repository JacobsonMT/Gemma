	<h1>Help for search in Gemma</h1>

	<h2>Search syntax</h2>

	<p>
		Search terms can be free text (" <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=liver">liver</a>"), gene symbols ("
		<a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=ACAT1">ACAT1</a>") or other
		accession numbers for specific experiments or probes. Here are some
		more complicated examples to explain query logic:
	<ul class='plainlist'>
		<li><a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=female%20%20cortex&scope=E">female
				cortex</a> - Union of items matching either terms; alterantively you can
			use <a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=female%20OR%20cortex&scope=E">female
				OR cortex</a> .</li>
		<li><a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=female%20AND%20cortex&scope=E">female
				AND cortex</a> - Inteserction of items matching terms. Note that 'AND'
			must be capitalized.</li>
		<li><a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=female%20-cortex&scope=E">female
				-cortex</a> - Exclusion.</li>
		<li><a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=%22cerebral%20cortex%22&scope=E">"cerebral
				cortex"</a> - search for a phrase.</li>
	</ul>


	For detailed information on the supported query syntax see
	<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html">this
		page</a>, which refers to '
	<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>', the search engine
	employed by Gemma.

	</p>


	<h2>Search scope</h2>
	<p>Besides the term(s) you want to search for, you must choose the
		search scope. Assuming you have cookies enabled in your browser, Gemma
		will remember your settings. It's a good idea to restrict searches to
		just the items you want to avoid longer waits.</p>

	<p>The available search scopes are:</p>

	<ul class="plainList">
		<li>Genes, by official symbol, alias, or name. Examples: <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=mGluR5&scope=G">mGluR5</a> or <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptor&scope=G">metabotropic
				glutamate receptor</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Sequences - The nucleotide sequences used on arrays, often
			referred to by Genbank identifiers identifier. Examples: <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=AA486221&scope=S">AA486221</a>. You
			can also retrieve sequences via associated genes or probes.
		</li>
		<li>Experiments - An expression experiment, searchable by text or
			the accession. For example <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=GSE60&scope=E">GSE60</a> or <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=liver&scope=E">liver</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Platforms - Expression analysis platforms or 'array designs',
			such as " <a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=HG-U133A&scope=A">HG-U133A</a>".
		</li>
		<li>Probes - Components of array platforms, usually referred to
			by the manufacturer's id, the id in GEO, or a Genbank accession. For
			example, <a href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=1450202_at&scope=P">1450202_at</a>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Search results</h2>

	<p>Each category of search result is presented separately in the
		table. A link is provided to a detailed view of each result items. If
		available, the text that your query matched will be shown below the
		results (hide/show the details using the button on the top of the
		results table).</p>
	<p>If the query you ran returned many results, you may find 'Find
		in results' useful. Type here to restrict your view.</p>
	<p>Note that results are limited to 500 items. For some queries,
		the number of results may be limited even more; if you don't see what
		you are looking for, try a more specific query.</p>

	<h2>Common tasks</h2>

	<h3>Find probes for a gene</h3>

	<p>The best way to do this is to first locate the gene, and follow
		the link provided to the details page for the genes. From there click
		on the "probes" link to view all probes for that gene.</p>

	<p>The alternative, of searching for 'probes' with the gene symbol,
		will yield less precise results.</p>

	<h2>Technical details</h2>
	<p>Gemma actually employs three different types of searches and
		combines the results.</p>
	<ul class="plainlist">
		<li>Database search - The query term entered is searched against
			fields in the Gemma database for exact matches. This is how queries
			for Genbank identifiers are handled.</li>
		<li>Full text search - Gemma indexes free text such as PubMed
			abstracts associated with data setts or descriptive text from GEO
			entries. These queries use <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>
			through a <a href="http://www.compass-project.org/">Compass</a>
			interface.
		</li>
		<li>Structured annotation search - Search terms are looked for in
			ontologies using <a
			href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/ARQ/lucene-arq.html">LARQ</a>.
			Entities in Gemma which are annotated with the returned terms (or
			subclasses of the returned terms) are returned after the logic of the
			user's query is applied. For example, ' <a
			href="/Gemma/searcher.html?query=cortex%20AND%20lung&scope=E">cortex
				AND lung</a>' will only return datasets which are annotated with an
			ontology term related to 'cortex' and also annotated with a term
			related to 'lung'. (By related, meaning either the term or a
			subclass; thus 'cortex' also returns 'hippocampus').
		</li>
	</ul>
