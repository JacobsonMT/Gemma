			Gemma currently has the ability to perform only one kind of
			meta-analysis, for recurring patterns of co-expression. Additional
			capabilities will be added in the future.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Caveats
		</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Not every data set is available for every type of analysis. In some
				cases data sets are not sufficiently annotated yet, or the data set
				is too small to use. However we provisionally retain the data.
			</li>
			<li>
				Results may vary over time, as we reannotate the sequences on the
				microarrays, add data sets, or modify algorithms.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			Recurring co-expression analysis
		</h2>

		<p>
			The methods used for "recurring coexpression" analysis are
			essentially as described in
			<a href="">Lee et al, 2004</a>. Briefly, each data set is
			preprocessed and analyzed to identify pairs of genes that are
			strongly coexpressed. The on-line analysis searches these results for
			pairs of genes that are coexpressed in multiple data sets, starting
			from a gene you choose.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, starting with YFG, you might discover that YFG is
			coexpressed with YOFG in 4 independent studies. The value '4' is the
			stringency at which the pair of genes YFG + YOFG are coexpressed. By
			changing the stringency to higher or lower values, you can reduce or
			increase the number of results you get back. You can also limit the
			expression data sets that are included in the search.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Interpretation
		</h3>

		<p>
			The idea behind recurring co-expression analysis is simply an
			extension of the idea of using coexpression on a single data set:
			that two genes that are coexpressed are more likely to be
			functionally related that two genes that are not coexpressed. Thus we
			would like to be able to say that genes that are coexpressed in
			multiple data sets are even more likely to be functionally related.
			Not too surprisingly, we found this wass the case in our previous
			work.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are two types of false positives you may get. First,
			statistical false positives are genes that are observed as
			coexpressed in multiple data sets purely by chance. Second, there can
			be "biological false positives", in which two genes might be
			coexpressed but inferring a strong functional relationship between
			the genes would be misleading or incorrect.
		</p>
		<p>
			Choosing the correct stringency is important, as results that are
			observed (say) only twice in 50 data sets might not be due to chance.
			While we are still calibrating the analyses, our prior work showed
			that in a specific database of 60 data sets, a stringency of 3 or 4
			was sufficient to weed out most false positives.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second type of false positives are harder to address. Our earlier
			studies showed that in terms of Gene Ontology categories, each data
			set a pair of genes was coexpressed in was "worth", on average, an
			additional Gene Ontology term in common. That is, genes coexpressed
			in 5 data sets would on average share 2 more GO terms than genes
			coexpressed in 3 data sets. The catch is this is "on average" and
			also surely depends on the data sets used. Therefore, we primarly
			offer coexpression results as a form of hypothesis generation that
			benefits greatly from addition of other prior information. Improving
			this aspect of the analysis is the topic of ongoing research.
