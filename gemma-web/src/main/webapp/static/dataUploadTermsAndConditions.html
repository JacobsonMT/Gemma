	<h1>
		Gemma terms and conditions
	</h1>

	<p>
		Most of this document relates to the upload of data in Gemma, but covers other uses as well. Your use of the site implies
		acceptance of this agreement.
	</p>

	<p>
		Definitions:
	</p>
	<ul class="plainList">
		<li>
			The Gemma website ("Gemma") encompasses the Gemma web site, underlying database, and software hosted at the University of
			British Columbia. Obviously if you are using Gemma installed somewhere else or in a private installation, none of this
			applies!
		</li>
		<li>
			The developers and maintainers of Gemma ("We") are the parties involved in running Gemma's software and hardware.
		</li>
		<li>
			"Use of Gemma" means accessing the Gemma through a web browser, web service or other electronic means, including uploading
			or downloading data, searching, using analytical tools or visualizations.
		</li>
		<li>
			"Data" or "Expression data" refers to gene expression profiling data of the sort that is stored in Gemma; that is,
			including but not necessarily limited to microarray data. This is the type of data you can upload!
		</li>

		<li>
			The user of Gemma ("You") are the uploader of data or user of the web site.
		</li>
		<li>
			"Public" data are data which are open to be accessed, analyzed and viewed in Gemma by any user of the web site.
		</li>
		<li>
			"Private" data are data which are limited in access to a subset of users, whether you, another user(s), or the
			administrators of Gemma.
		</li>
	</ul>


	<p>
		The rules:
	</p>
	<ol class='plainList'>
		<li>
			You must be a registered user of Gemma to upload data.
		</li>
		<li>
			You promise not to upload data which would allow individual identification of humans (in the sense defined by the US HIPAA
			law). For example, data with the names of human subjects in the sample names is unacceptable.
		</li>
		<li>
			We will never use non-public data stored in Gemma in any data analysis not explicitly authorized by you, nor will we
			transmit your data to any third party. We claim no rights over your data other than control over its presence in the Gemma
			database. The Gemma administrators will have access to your data for the purpose of maintenance only. We never distribute
			personal information such as email addresses to third parties for any purpose.
		</li>
		<li>
			While we make every effort to keep your data accurate (as you uploaded it), secure and private (if you request that you
			data be kept private), uploads and all other uses of Gemma are at your own risk. Neither the University of British
			Columbia nor us will be held liable for any real or perceived consequences of the use of Gemma. We encourage users
			with data they consider too sensitive to put on the public Gemma site to consider a local installation of Gemma.
		</li>
		<li>
			Data are stored in Gemma indefinitely unless you ask us to remove it, though we reserve the right to delete data at any
			time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Data that has already been published cannot be stored in Gemma without making the data public. If we discover that you
			have uploaded published data and have not check the 'make public' box, we reserve the right to make the data public
			without notifying you. We define 'published' as any dissemination of a description of the expression study in a
			peer-reviewed publication, even if the expression data themselves were not originally part of the dissemination or
			supplementary materials. That is, description of the data collection and presentation of a "hit list" constitutes
			publication of the data. In the case of grievances about public access of data in Gemma, we will be happy to delete your
			data from the system. The reason for this policy is to encourage the open sharing of data after publication, while
			allowing Gemma to be used to analyze data prior to publication.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you use results from Gemma in a publication or scientific presentation, we ask that you cite the web site (see
			information elsewhere on the site).
		</li>
