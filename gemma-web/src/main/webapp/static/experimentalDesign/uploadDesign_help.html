	Instructions for experimental design creation

<h3>
	Introduction: What is an experimental design?
</h3>

<p>
	All experiments worthy of the name have a design. For our purposes, an experimental design is the set of variables
	<em>controlled</em> or
	<em>measured</em> by the experimenter and which are treated as 'independent variables' (In expression studies the
	dependent variable is the expression level). Examples of controlled variables might be a drug treatment or genotype.
	Measured variables are more common in human studies which have an observational aspect (as opposed to an intervention).
	Examples might be age or blood pressure. The variables can be categorical (genotype) or continuous (blood pressure).
	Continuous variables are sometimes made categorical by binning.
</p>
<p>
	GEO calls these variables 'series variables'. Databases founded on the MAGE Object Model (e.g., ArrayExpress) call them
	'Experimental Factors'. Because Gemma was heavily influenced by MAGE-OM, we use the term 'experimental factor' or
	'factor' for short. The values a factor takes in an experiment are the 'factor values'.
</p>
<p>
	Clearly to analyze an expression study the experimental design must be encoded in a way the software can understand.
	This page explains how this is done in Gemm.
</p>


<h3>
	From a text file import
</h3>

<p>
	For complex experiments, or if you are moving data into Gemma from another database, it may be easier to populate the
	design using a text file. The catch is you have to create a file in the right format. The design editor (described
	below) is more forgiving in some ways, by dint of its interactive nature. However, we consider the design editor a
	'curator-level' tool and some casual users may find it fiddly or idiosyncratic (improvements are in the works).
</p>

<p>
	The file format for designs is fairly simple. It can be created in a program like Excel (then saved as 'ASCII text').
	You can see examples by downloading experimental design files for experiments that are already populated, and Gemma
	will provide a partly-filled template file to start you off.
</p>

<p>
	Here is a real example as you might set it up. In this study two metal exposures were used, plus a control group.

<p>
	There are two main sections you have to attend to:
</p>

<ul class='plainList'>
	<li>
		A header which provides details about the factors (lines starting with '$'). There will be one of these lines for each
		factor. Each line has two parts, separated by a colon (':'). The text before the colon must be a valid MGED category
		term from a short list Gemma supports (list provided below). The text after the colon can be any text describing the
		factor (briefly).
	</li>
	<li>
		A tabular section which shows the factor values for each sample. The first column contains the names of the samples.
		These must exactly match the names in the actual experiment, so we strongly recommend starting with a template file
		provided by Gemma. The remaining columns give the "factor values" for the factor(s). These are relatively
		self-explanatory to set up. Note that the column headings must match the factor names you provided in the header
		section.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The file can also contain comments on lines starting with '#'. Such lines are ignored by the parser.
</p>

<h3>
	Manually, using the experimental design editor
</h3>

<p>
	Even if you use the file import method, the design editor might still be useful if you need to make changes to the
	design.
</p>

<p>
	The design editor has two tabs: one to display and define Experimental Factors and the corresponding Factor Values; and
	a second to view and edit the assignment of Factor Values to the samples in the study.
</p>



<h3>
	Supported MGED terms
</h3>

<p>
	Each factor must be assigned to a
	<em>category</em> corresponding to an MGED Ontology term. The current list of supported terms for Factors is below. If
	you are unsure what term to use, consult usage in Gemma, the MGED Ontology documentation or use a generic term like
	'Treatment'. In our experience these terms cover most possibilities. The most commonly used are 'OrganismPart' (which
	tissue, etc.) 'CellType' and the rather generic 'Treatment'.
