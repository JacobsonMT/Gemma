	<p>
		An "experimental design" describes the characteristics of each sample as is relevant to the analysis of the
		experiment. Experimental designs are not populated for all studies, as this has to be done manually in many cases.
		Some studies were annotated by GEO curators and those annotations appear in Gemma.
	</p>

	<p>
		On this page, the details of the experimental design are shown. The second tab ("BioMaterials") provides a
		complete list of the samples in the study and the parameters that apply to each sample.

	<h2>
		About experimental designs
	</h2>

	<p>
		An experimental design (ED) is organized around
		<em>experimental factors</em> (EFs), listed near the top of the page. A factor is a known variable in an experiment,
		such as "age", "genotype" or "treatment". An experiment can have any number of factors, but most have only 1-3.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each sample has a specific
		<em>Factor Value</em> (FV) for each
		<em>Factor</em>. For example, for 'genotype', the available values might be "wild-type" and "mutant". For a parameter
		like "age", the values might be continuous values (numbers) like "10.1 years". The available factor values for a given
		EF are shown in the middle of the page.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because experimental designs are curated manually (either by us or by the original source, such as GEO), it is
		certainly possible for errors to exist. If you spot a problem, please contact
