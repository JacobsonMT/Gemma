# Important instructions on working with the UML files.
# $Id$

The new UML2 format requires a little more work to prepare for commits to the repository.

First, in MagicDraw you must export the model as Eclipse EMF 1.0. 
This creats the file gemma-om.uml2.

You will get complaints from MagicDraw that it cannot write to the files. 
Thus you should use the 'Team->edit' function on all the *.uml2 files in this
directory (you can do it all at once).

Then commit the gemma-om.uml2 and gemma-om.xml.zip files as well as all the *.uml2 profile files. 
Do not commit any *.uml files that may have been generated by Eclipse's EMF.
